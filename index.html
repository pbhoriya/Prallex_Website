            <h2 class="AT">Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="textdata">"An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and
                forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be
                described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or
                in favour.”
                <br> <br>
                Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge, learning new things about the
                surroundings and about one’s own self and making lots of great stories. Going for an adventure camp is
                the best way to get all of these as it forces one to get out of their ordinary lives and try new things.
                Adventure camp basically means spending the nights in tents and doing various activities at the
                camp-site.

                <h2 class="midhead">BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="textdata">Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it
                strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.
                If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.
                <br> <br>
                You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a
                stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.
                If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also
                engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking. You can do it
                on trails and different types of rough terrain.

                <h2 class="midhead">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="textdata">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders:
                lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot
                sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by
                the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br> <br>
                Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports,
                and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible
                than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding
                is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.

                <h2 class="midhead">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="textdata">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem
                surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually
                carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,
                but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal
                bore, or in wave pools.
                <br> <br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on
                their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a
                wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
